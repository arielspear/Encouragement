# Project Name

Encouragement is an Android app designed to give people compliments and affirmations. It's supposed to provide people with a small positive message.

## Installation

Encouragement can be installed from the Google Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arielspear.encouragement&hl=en).
